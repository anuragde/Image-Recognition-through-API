Improvements:
1. Search for any updates (deletion/addition) in the input file periodically (say, every 1 hour).
Solution: Google Drive API can be used to check for file additions or deletions and append the data structure or delete the data of deleted images.

2. Store the results in a database or provide the results file to the user to avoid prediction cost next time.
